Stock Price Fetcher

ðŸ“Œ What This Script Does

The stockprice is a tool that fetches real-time stock prices and answers to the user. It allows users to quickly check the latest stock prices directly from their terminal.

ðŸ“Œ Why This Script is Useful

Quick & Easy: No need to open a browser or a stock app.

Lightweight: Runs instantly with no extra software needed.

Automated: Fetches live stock prices in one command.

Customizable: Can be modified to add more features.

ðŸ“Œ How to Use

Open the terminal and run the script with a stock ticker:

stockprice AAPL

The output will look like this:

-----------------------------------

Stock Symbol: AAPL

Current Time: Thu Mar 6 03:20:00 UTC 2025

Current Price: 235.74 USD

-----------------------------------

To check another stock, just replace AAPL with another ticker, such as:

stockprice TSLA


ðŸ“Œ Notes

The script is case-insensitive for stock symbols (e.g., aapl or AAPL both work).

The script can be modified to support additional data like volume, market cap, etc.
