## Title of the Project
Predicting Wine Quality Based on Physicochemical Properties

### Project Objectives
This project aims to analyze the relationship between physicochemical properties and wine quality ratings. 
We will explore how factors such as alcohol content, acidity, and sugar levels influence the quality score. 
The objective is to identify key predictors of high-quality wines,by analizing both red and white wine, to understand the correlations among variables. 
The analysis will help reveal hidden patterns that winemakers and wine buyers could take into account when making or buying wine.
